# Food-Nutrients-Analysis-
In this Microsoft Excel project, I analyzed food nutrients and created a dashboard to summarize key insights. I used functions like average, count, max, sum, if, and lookup, along with pivot tables and charts (column, pie, line). I enhanced the dashboard with slicers, trend lines, spark lines, and forecasting.
